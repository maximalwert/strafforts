on\nall activities at the time when this action was taken.\nIt won't recalculate all best efforts on all activities in a timely fashion.\nThis means if the athlete realized the situation too late,\nthat there have 2nd best efforts, 3rd best efforts in other activities uploaded after this activity,\nrefreshing the achievements will result in nothing.\nBecause at the refreshing process, Strava will treat the later activities as 1st, 2nd and so on.\nBut since you are not refreshing those activities, best efforts on those activities won't be updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay for example,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActivity ID 11111: 5k 10 minutes, 1st best efforts for 5k\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eActivity ID 22222: 5k 25 minutes, 2nd best efforts for

5k\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen activity 11111 was refreshed due to wrong activity type,\nso there will be no more '1st best efforts' for 5k on this activity.\nAll other activities will remain the same too, which means there is no more '1st best efforts' on any activities.\nIf you refresh the achievements of 22222 now, it will become '3rd best efforts for 5k'.\nBecause Strava recalculates achievements based on all existing activities as of the time refreshing is done,\n25 minutes is only the '3rd best efforts for 5k' now.
